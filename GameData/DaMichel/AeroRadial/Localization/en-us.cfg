	// Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell (RFC)
		#DAR-RFC-titl = PB-ZAP - A Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell
		#DAR-RFC-desc = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power. This is a streamlined, radially attached version which makes a great addition to any space plane. Handy for those places where a solar panel will not do.  Also handy for re-heating snacks. Attempts to use in vacuum have summoned rather large, pesky and unwanted multi-tentacled creatures. // #DM-RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power.

	// Radial Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)
		#DAR-RTG-titl = PB-NUK - An Aerodynamic Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
		#DAR-RTG-desc = Through exploitation of the natural decay of Blutonium-238, this elegantly simple power generator can provide consistent, stable power for decades. This is a streamlined, radially attached version which makes a great addition to any space plane.
