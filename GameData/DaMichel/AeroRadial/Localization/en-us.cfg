		// Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell (RFC)
		#DM_RFC_title = PB-ZAP A Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell // #DM-RFC_title = PB-ZAP A Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell Generator
		#DM_RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power. This is a streamlined, radially attached version which makes a great addition to any space plane. Handy for those places where a solar panel will not do.  Also handy for re-heating snacks. Attempts to use in vacuum have summoned rather large, pesky and unwanted multi-tentacled creatures. // #DM-RFC_description = This elegantly simple fuel cell power generator that allows liquid fuel and intake air to be converted into consistent, stable power.
